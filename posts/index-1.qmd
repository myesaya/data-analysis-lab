## Goal

Identify factors affecting the functionality of infrastructure in rural communities.

## Method

-   Survey data collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from public tools.
-   Created a binary outcome variable for functionality (functional vs non-functional).
-   Conducted data cleaning, variable recoding, and multivariate binary logistic regression.

## Results

A multivariable binary logistic regression identified several factors significantly associated with functionality. The results are presented in Table 1.

| Variable                  | Coefficient | p-value | Odds Ratio | 95% CI (OR) |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Maintenance frequency     | 0.65        | 0.03    | 1.91       | 1.06 – 3.45 |
| Distance to service point | -0.42       | 0.05    | 0.66       | 0.44 – 1.00 |
| Community management      | 0.78        | 0.01    | 2.18       | 1.20 – 3.95 |
| Monetary contribution     | 0.55        | 0.04    | 1.73       | 1.02 – 2.95 |
| Technical support         | 0.48        | 0.06    | 1.62       | 0.98 – 2.68 |

## Interpretation of Results:

-   **Maintenance frequency:** Regular maintenance significantly increases the odds of functionality (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.06–3.45, p = 0.03), meaning units with consistent maintenance are 91% more likely to remain functional.\
-   **Distance to service point:** Longer distance shows a non-significant negative effect (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.41–1.05, p = 0.08), suggesting a possible decrease in functionality but not statistically confirmed.\
-   **Community management:** Strong management significantly improves functionality (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.20–3.95, p = 0.01), more than doubling the likelihood of operational infrastructure.\
-   **Monetary contribution:** Units with higher community monetary support have significantly increased functionality (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.02–2.95, p = 0.04).\
-   **Technical support:** Presence of technical support shows a positive but non-significant effect (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 0.90–2.91, p = 0.12).

## Conclusion:

Maintenance frequency, community management, and monetary contribution are statistically significant predictors of infrastructure functionality.Distance to service point and technical support may influence outcomes, but their effects are not statistically confirmed.

Focus on regular maintenance, strong management, and community contributions to improve operational results.
