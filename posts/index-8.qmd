## Goal

Investigate factors influencing household solid waste quantities and disposal by burning.


## Method

-   Collected solid waste from 150 households over a week.

-   Measured waste quantities on a weighing scale (fractions of kg).

-   Conducted **waste characterisation** (organic, plastic, paper, others).

-   Assessed **normality** using **QQ plots**.

-   Applied **Poisson regression** to identify contextual factors associated with differences in waste quantities.

**Example contextual factors considered:**

-   Household size\
-   Income level\
-   Presence of children\
-   Frequency of collection\
-   Access to bins
-   
## Results

Table 1: Poisson regression results showing factors associated with household solid waste quantities (Significant P values in bold)

| Variable        | Estimate | Std. Error | z value | p-value       |
|-----------------|----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| (Intercept)     | 1.60     | 0.20       | 8.00    | **<0.001**   |
| Household size  | 0.10     | 0.03       | 3.33    | **0**.**001** |
| Income (Medium) | 0.05     | 0.08       | 0.63    | 0.53          |
| Income (High)   | -0.08    | 0.09       | -0.89   | 0.37          |
| Children        | 0.07     | 0.04       | 1.75    | 0.08          |
| Access to bins  | -0.20    | 0.09       | -2.22   | **0.026**     |

## Interpretation:

**Household size**: Larger households produce significantly more waste (p = 0.001).

**Access to bins:** Households with bin access produce less waste, likely due to reduced burning (p = 0.026).

Other factors (income, children) show weaker associations.

## Conclusion and Policy Implications

Larger households generate more solid waste, and limited bin access increases the likelihood of burning waste. Policy makers should improve access to household or community bins, especially in high-density areas, promote regular waste collection services to prevent accumulation, and educate communities on safe disposal methods to reduce burning and associated health risks. Interventions can also target households producing the most waste based on size or composition. Poisson regression provides a data-driven basis for prioritising interventions and allocating resources.
