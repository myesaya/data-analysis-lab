## Goal
Compare the prevalence of a pig disease across three cities: Blantyre, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu.

## Method

- Cross-sectional survey of pig farms in the three cities.

- Calculated prevalence (%) for each farm

- Conducted **one-way ANOVA** to test for differences in mean prevalence

- Applied **Tukey post-hoc test** when ANOVA indicated significant differences.

## Results

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the mean prevalence of the disease across the three cities. When a significant difference was detected, pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey’s post-hoc test. The results are presented in Table 1.

Table 1: One-way ANOVA comparing mean prevalence of the disease across Blantyre, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu


| Source of Variation | SS    | df | MS    | F    | p-value   |
| ------------------- | ----- | -- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| Between Cities      | 145.2 | 2  | 72.6  | 5.48 | **0.007** |
| Within Cities       | 430.5 | 27 | 15.94 |      |           |
| Total               | 575.7 | 29 |       |      |           |


## Interpretation

-    The ANOVA shows a statistically significant difference in mean disease prevalence among the three cities (**p = 0.007)**

This indicates that at least one city differs from the others in terms of average prevalence.

## Turkey

Since the ANOVA results showed a significant difference in disease prevalence across the three cities, Tukey’s post-hoc test was carried out to identify which pairs of cities differed significantly. The results are presented in Table 2.

Table 2: Tukey’s post-hoc pairwise comparison of mean disease prevalence among Blantyre, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu

| Comparison           | Mean Difference | 95% CI     | p-value   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Blantyre vs Lilongwe | 6.5             | 1.2 – 11.8 | **0.014** |
| Blantyre vs Mzuzu    | 3.2             | -1.5 – 7.9 | 0.18      |
| Lilongwe vs Mzuzu    | -3.3            | -7.9 – 1.3 | 0.17      |


## Interpretation

-   **Blantyre vs Lilongwe:** Significant difference (**p = 0.014**); Blantyre has higher mean prevalence by 6.5%.

-   **Blantyre vs Mzuzu:** Not significant (p = 0.18); mean difference of 3.2% is not statistically meaningful.

-   **Lilongwe vs Mzuzu:** Not significant (p = 0.17); mean difference of -3.3% is not statistically meaningful.

## Conclusion

-   The overall prevalence of the pig disease differs significantly among the three cities.

-   Blantyre has significantly higher prevalence compared to Lilongwe, while differences with Mzuzu are not statistically significant.

-   This suggests that targeted interventions may be needed in Blantyre to control the disease.
