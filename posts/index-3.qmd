## Introduction

Cybersecurity awareness remains a growing concern as more people rely on
digital tools for financial transactions, communication, and information
access. Many users lack knowledge on identifying phishing attempts,
creating strong passwords, and verifying the authenticity of online
content. Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) interventions that combine
mass media and social engagement can play a key role in addressing these
gaps.

This report presents the results of a BCC intervention that used radio
programmes and online engagement to promote safe cybersecurity
practices. The objectives were to:

1.  Assess the level of audience engagement through radio and social
    media interactions.

2.  Measure the change in cybersecurity knowledge following exposure to
    the intervention using a differences-in-differences approach.

## Description of the Intervention

The intervention ran for three months and targeted adult listeners in
selected districts. Weekly 30-minute radio call-in programmes were
broadcast, focusing on topics such as detecting phishing links, setting
secure passwords, updating software, and avoiding scams.

Each episode encouraged listeners to ask questions by calling during
live sessions or sending messages through Facebook, SMS, or WhatsApp.
The radio programme was supported by:

-   Short radio spots that repeated key messages throughout the week.

-   Facebook posts summarising each episode.

-   SMS and WhatsApp tips sent to subscribers after every broadcast.

A call log system captured all engagements across platforms to
understand audience participation and the main cybersecurity issues
raised.

## Engagement Tracking

During the campaign, all incoming calls and messages were recorded. The
records captured the channel, time, and key phrases mentioned. Table 1
presents a sample of entries from the call log.

Table 1: Sample of Call Log Data

| ID | Channel | Timestamp | Text Message | Keywords |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Radio | 2025-09-01 09:15:00 | How do I know if a link is safe? | link, safe, phishing |
| 2 | Radio | 2025-09-01 09:18:30 | My bank asked for a PIN by SMS. | bank, sms, phishing |
| 3 | WhatsApp | 2025-09-01 10:05:12 | How can I enable two-factor authentication? | twofactor, password |
| 4 | Facebook | 2025-09-01 11:02:00 | Is antivirus protection enough? | antivirus, malware |
| 5 | SMS | 2025-09-01 12:00:00 | I received a link promising free airtime. Safe? | free, link, scam |

A total of 1,280 unique interactions were recorded across all platforms.
Radio accounted for 46 percent of engagements, followed by WhatsApp (28
percent), Facebook (17 percent), and SMS (9 percent). \## Keyword
Frequency and Word Cloud

Keywords were extracted from the call log to identify the most discussed
cybersecurity issues. Table 2 presents the top ten keywords and their
frequencies.

Table 2: Frequency of Engagement Keywords

| Word      | Frequency |
|-----------|----------:|
| phishing  |       120 |
| link      |        95 |
| password  |        85 |
| twofactor |        60 |
| malware   |        50 |
| bank      |        45 |
| update    |        40 |
| report    |        30 |
| free      |        28 |
| download  |        25 |

The words *phishing*, *password*, and *link* appeared most frequently,
reflecting participants’ interest in safe browsing and online
authentication as also visualised in @fig-pca-plot.

keywords <- data.frame(
  word = c("phishing","link","password","twofactor","malware","bank","update",
           "report","free","download","wifi","fraud","socialmedia","account",
           "login","antivirus","privacy","hacking","spam","firewall","vpn",
           "backup","data","email","scam","otp","browser","identity","safe","alert"),
  freq = c(120,95,85,60,50,45,40,30,28,25,22,20,19,18,17,16,15,15,14,13,
           12,12,11,10,10,9,8,8,7,7)
)

# Generate stable word cloud
wordcloud2(keywords, size = 1)


```

The resulting word cloud visually highlighted the prominence of key
cybersecurity terms. Larger words represented higher engagement levels,
with phishing-related queries dominating the discussion.

## Evaluation Design

A quasi-experimental design was used to assess the impact of the
intervention. Two groups were compared:

-   **Treatment group:** listeners within the radio broadcast coverage
    areas.

-   **Control group**: individuals from areas without access to the
    campaign.

Knowledge assessments were conducted at baseline and three months after
the intervention. Respondents were asked ten questions covering basic
cybersecurity practices, and scores were converted to a 0–100 scale.

The differences-in-differences (DiD) approach was used to estimate the
change in knowledge attributable to the campaign. The model took the
form:

𝑌 𝑖 𝑡 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 Treatment 𝑖 + 𝛽 2 Post 𝑡 + 𝛽 3 ( Treatment 𝑖 × Post 𝑡
) + 𝜖 𝑖 𝑡 Y it ​

where 𝑌 𝑖 𝑡 Y it ​is the knowledge score for individual 𝑖 i at time 𝑡 t,
and 𝛽 3 β 3 ​captures the effect of the intervention.

## Results

A total of 400 participants were included in the treatment group and 400
in the control group. The regression results are presented in Table 3.

Table 3: Differences-in-Differences Regression Results

| Variable | Coefficient | Std. Error | z | p-value | 95% CI (Lower) | 95% CI (Upper) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------:|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Intercept | 50.36 | 0.36 | 139.09 | 0.000 | 49.65 | 51.06 |
| Treatment | 0.98 | 0.53 | 1.85 | 0.065 | -0.06 | 2.02 |
| Post | 1.12 | 0.49 | 2.29 | 0.022 | 0.16 | 2.08 |
| Treat × Post | 4.25 | 0.70 | 6.07 | 0.000 | 2.88 | 5.62 |

The results show that the treatment × post-intervention interaction term
is positive and statistically significant (p \< 0.001). Participants
exposed to the campaign improved their cybersecurity knowledge by an
average of 4.25 points more than those in the control group.

The treatment effect at baseline (p = 0.065) indicates minor initial
differences between groups, while the post variable (p = 0.022) suggests
a small general improvement across both groups over time.

## Interpretation

The findings provide strong evidence that the radio-based BCC
intervention improved cybersecurity knowledge. The significant treatment
× post coefficient confirms that exposure to the campaign led to
measurable learning gains. The modest baseline difference supports the
comparability of the groups.

A four-point improvement in knowledge represents a meaningful change
given the short campaign period. Listeners showed greater awareness of
phishing, password safety, and software updates. These findings were
reinforced by engagement data, which highlighted frequent discussion of
phishing and password topics during radio sessions and online chats.

The results suggest that combining traditional media with interactive
digital channels can enhance the effectiveness of public awareness
campaigns. Feedback mechanisms such as WhatsApp and Facebook messages
allowed audiences to clarify doubts and apply what they learned in real
time.

## Conclusion

The behaviour change communication intervention on cybersecurity
achieved its objective of increasing awareness among listeners. Radio
proved to be an effective medium for disseminating digital safety
information, while interactive channels such as WhatsApp and Facebook
enhanced engagement and retention.

The differences-in-differences analysis showed that knowledge scores
improved significantly among those exposed to the campaign. Word cloud
analysis of engagement data revealed that phishing and password security
were the most prominent areas of concern.

Continued reinforcement of cybersecurity messages through regular
broadcasts, supported by digital media engagement, could help sustain
and expand these gains. Future interventions should measure behavioural
outcomes, such as the number of phishing reports or password updates, to
determine whether improved awareness translates into safer online
practices.
