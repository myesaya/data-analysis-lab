## Goal

Visualise how menstrual hygiene materials are disposed of in three
communities.

Focus on the flow from **materials used** to **disposal methods** using
a **Sankey diagram**.

## Method

-   Cross-sectional survey of 200 menstruating individuals across three
    communities.

-   Collected data on **materials used**: Pads, Cloth, Tampons, Cups,
    Others.

-   Collected data on **disposal methods**: Bins, Pits, Burning,
    Flushing, Reuse, Composting.

-   Tabulated the number of users flowing from each material to each
    disposal method.

-   Visualised flows using a **Sankey diagram** to identify dominant
    disposal pathways.

## Results

Below is the Sankey diagram illustrating the flow from menstrual hygiene
materials to disposal methods.

# R code for Sankey diagram
library(networkD3)

# Define nodes
nodes <- data.frame(name = c(
  "Pads", "Cloth", "Tampons", "Cups", "Other",
  "Bins", "Pits", "Burning", "Flushing", "Reuse", "Composting"
))

# Define links (flows)
links <- data.frame(
  source = c(0,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4),
  target = c(5,6,7,5,10,7,8,10,9,5,6),
  value = c(80, 30, 10, 50, 20, 15, 5, 10, 8, 5, 3)
)

# Create Sankey diagram
sankeyNetwork(Links = links, Nodes = nodes, 
              Source = "source", Target = "target", 
              Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
              fontSize = 14, nodeWidth = 30)
```

**Explanation of flows (fake data example):**

-   **Pads:** 80 users dispose in bins, 30 in pits, 10 by burning.

-   **Cloth:** 50 users dispose by reuse, 20 via composting.

-   **Tampons:** 15 users burn, 5 flush.

-   **Cups:** 10 users compost, 8 reuse.

-   **Other absorbents:** 5 dispose in bins, 3 in pits.

The diagram highlights the **dominant disposal routes** for each
material.

## Interpretation

-   **Bins** are the primary disposal method for pads and other
    absorbents

-   **Reuse** is common for cloth and cups, suggesting a potential for
    **hygiene education and resource efficiency**.

-   Burning and flushing are minor but present, indicating
    **environmental risks**

-   Composting is rare, suggesting opportunities for **sustainable
    disposal interventions**

-   Sankey visualisation effectively shows **which materials contribute
    most to each disposal method**, guiding intervention planning.

## Conclusion

-   Pads are the most commonly disposed material, primarily in bins

-   Cloth and cups tend to be reused, indicating potential for education
    on safe washing practices.

-   Interventions could focus on reducing unsafe disposal (burning,
    flushing) and promoting sustainable options (composting)

-   The Sankey diagram helps stakeholders **visually understand disposal
    flows**, informing targeted MHM interventions.
