    "text": "Conclusion and Policy Implications\nLarger households generate more solid waste, and limited bin access increases the likelihood of burning waste. Policy makers should improve access to household or community bins, especially in high-density areas, promote regular waste collection services to prevent accumulation, and educate communities on safe disposal methods to reduce burning and associated health risks. Interventions can also target households producing the most waste based on size or composition. Poisson regression provides a data-driven basis for prioritising interventions and allocating resources."

The modest baseline difference supports the comparability of the groups.\nA four-point improvement in knowledge represents a meaningful change given the short campaign period. Listeners showed greater awareness of phishing, password safety, and software updates. These findings were reinforced by engagement data, which highlighted frequent discussion of phishing and password topics during radio sessions and online chats.\nThe results suggest that combining traditional media with interactive digital channels can enhance the effectiveness of public awareness campaigns.

Radio proved to be an effective medium for disseminating digital safety information, while interactive channels such as WhatsApp and Facebook enhanced engagement and retention.\nThe differences-in-differences analysis showed that knowledge scores improved significantly among those exposed to the campaign. Word cloud analysis of engagement data revealed that phishing and password security were the most prominent areas of concern.\nContinued reinforcement of cybersecurity messages through regular broadcasts, supported by digital media engagement, could help sustain and expand these gains. Future interventions should measure behavioural outcomes, such as the number of phishing reports or password updates, to determine whether improved awareness translates into safer online practices."

    "text": "Interpretation\nRespondents with secondary and tertiary education were significantly more likely to have positive perceptions of rainwater harvesting compared to those with primary education (p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, households with higher monthly income (&gt;MWK 100,000) showed greater likelihood of supporting RWH initiatives. Gender and age were not significantly associated with perceptions.\nThese findings suggest that educational exposure and economic capacity play key roles in shaping positive attitudes toward rainwater harvesting practices in peri-urban Mzuzu."

Future awareness campaigns should target less-educated and lower-income groups, focusing on the affordability and long-term benefits of household water collection."

    "text": "Interpretation\n\nThe dual-axis plot shows that as years progress, both sludge volume and the proportion of pits requiring emptying decrease steadily.\nCircular pits initially produced slightly higher volumes, but the difference between pit types diminished over time.\nThe pattern indicates that annual emptying programmes reduce long-term accumulation, allowing cities to plan realistic treatment capacity.\nThe decline is gradual, not abrupt, suggesting consistent maintenance rather than one-time emptying.\nOne key limitation is that the projections did not include future population growth as estimated by the National Statistics Office, which may increase total sludge volume in subsequent years."
